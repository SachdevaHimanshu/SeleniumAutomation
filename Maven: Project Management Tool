Maven is a powerful Project Management and build management tool. It provides following features and advantage.
1. Central repository to get dependencies.
2. Maintaining common project structure across the organizatiom: The src/main/java directory contains the project source code, the src/test/java directory contains 
the test source, and the pom.xml file is the configuration file.
3. Flexibility in integrating with CI tools like Jenkins. 

Maven POM
POM is a Project Object Model XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. 
It contains default values for most projects. Some of the configurations that can be specified in the POM are the project dependencies, 
the plugins or goals that can be executed, the build profiles, and so on.

Surefire Plugin
The Surefire Plugin is used during the test phase of the build lifecycle to execute the unit tests of an application. It generates reports in 2 different file formats:
1. Plain text files (*.txt)
2. XML files (*.xml)
By default, these files are generated in ${basedir}/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml.

Note: The Surefire Plugin has only one goal: surefire:test -runs the unit tests of an application.
The Surefire Plugin can be invoked by calling the test phase of the build lifecycle: mvn test
This plugin will help to execute all the test cases present in test folder: src/test/java.
As long as they are named in accordance with the defaults such as *Test.java they will be run by Surefire as TestNG tests.
But if there is a .java class that is not following the above naming convention but still needs to be inluded then use below.
        <configuration>
          <includes>
            <include>Sample.java</include>
          </includes>
        </configuration>
	and to exclude use below:
	<configuration>
          <excludes>
            <exclude>**/TestCircle.java</exclude>
            <exclude>**/TestSquare.java</exclude>
          </excludes>
        </configuration>


maven commands: clean
compile: checks syntax errors of code
test: if command test is given then maven first compiles then test.

Using Suite XML Files: Another alternative is to use TestNG suite XML files. This allows flexible configuration of the tests to be run.
