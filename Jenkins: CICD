Jenkins: Continous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
When our automated tests are ready we club all required tests and run those tests either by running Testng.xml or running POM.xml(maven command) file manually by using run as in eclipse.
This is also a manual task which needs to be automated. If a set of test cases are supposed to be run daily at mid night to as to receive the report
in morning we should not be running test manually in eclipse at mid night.
The solution is to create/Schedule a JOB in Jenkins. 

Jenkins facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery in software projects by automating parts related to build, test, and deployment.
