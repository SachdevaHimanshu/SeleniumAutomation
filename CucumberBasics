#Cucumber
Cucumber is a testing tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It allows automation of functional validation in easily readable 
and understandable format (like plain English)(Gerkin) to Business Analysts, Developers, Testers, etc.
Cucumber Basics
In order to understand cucumber, we need to know all the features of cucumber and its usage.
#1) Feature Files:
A standalone unit or a single functionality (such as a login) for a project can be called a Feature. Each of these features
will have scenarios that must be tested using Selenium integrated with Cucumber. A file that stores data about features, 
their descriptions, and the scenarios to be tested, is called a Feature File. Extension : Login.feature

Description: The user shall be able to login upon entering the correct username and password in the correct fields. 
The user should be directed to the homepage if the username and password entered are correct.

Sample feature file for login feature: In order to ensure Login Functionality works, I want to run the cucumber test to verify it is working
Feature: Login Functionality Feature
Scenario: Login Functionality
Given user navigates to SOFTWARETETINGHELP.COM
When user logs in using Username as “USER” and Password “PASSWORD”
Then login should be successful

#2. Step Definitions
Now that the features and their scenarios are written in the feature files, the code for the related scenario has to be run. To know which batch of code needs to 
be run for a given scenario, Steps Definitions come into the picture. A Steps Definitions file stores the mapping data between each step of 
a scenario defined in the feature file and the code to be executed.
