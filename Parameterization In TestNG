Parameterization in Selenium
Parameterization is passing different set of values to the test script or functions at the run time.
Many a times a particular funtionality or feature (Eg Login) has to be tested with multiple set of values hence the test script of that 
funtionality or feature is passed with all permutations and combinations of those values.
This way the we automatically runs test cases multiple times using different values.

Type of Parameterization in TestNG-

1. With the help of  @Parameters annotation and TestNG XML file.

  @Parameters({"URL","Username","Pin"})
	@Test
	public void Demo(String URL, String username, Integer pin)
	{
		System.out.println(URL + Username + Pin);s
	}
