TestNG is a powerful testing framework, an enhanced version of JUnit. NG stands for 'Next Generation'.

#TestNG provides Powerful and wide variety of annotations to support your test cases.
Annotations are placed just above the methods. Annotations describes and defines how the methods will be executed.

#@Test : Most important annotation in TestNG framework. All the functionalities that needs to be tested are kept inside the @Test annotated method.

Attributes associated with the TestNG annotation are:
1. @Test(description=”This test validates login functionality”)
2. @Test(priority=1): You can prioritize the order of execution of your test methods by defining a priority.
3. @Test(dependsOnMethod=”Login”): This attribute is used if a test case is dependent on the other test case. 
   For example, to view Home Page details, you need to login to the application. So, your HomePage test case is dependent on the login test case.
4. @Test(enabled=’true’): If a test method is having enabled=’true’ then that will be skipped.

5. @Test(groups=”Smoke Suite”) : Different @test methods belonging to same or different classes can be Grouped together by using "groups" attribute.
   =>This way all the testcases belonging to a group can be run and tested together.
   It is important to note that execution of a Group is declared in the testng.xml file in the TestNG and can be found inside <test> tag or <suite> tag.
   =>Also, remember that the groups defined in <test> tag apply to only that particular test tag, but the groups defined in <suite> tag 
   apply to all the <test> tags in the XML file.
   
   e.g Suppose we have 2 .java class 
     1. HomeLoanTest and 2. CarLoanTest
     
      public class HomeLoanTest 
      {
         Test(groups = {"Mobile login","HomeLoan"})
         public void HomeLoanMObileLogin()
         {
            System.out.println("Testing HomeLoanMObileLogin");
         }

         @Test(groups = {"HomeLoan"})
         public void HomeLoanWebLogin()
         {
            System.out.println("Testing HomeLoanWebLogin");
         }
      }
   
   public class CarLoanTest {
	
      @Test(groups = "Mobile login")
      public void CarLoanMObileLogin()
      {
         System.out.println("Testing CarLoanMObileLogin");
      }

      @Test(groups = {"Web login"})
      public void CarLoanWebLogin()
      {
         System.out.println("Testing CarLoanWebLogin");
      }
	}
   
   
   ==>.xml file
   <suite name="Suite">
	<test thread-count="5" name="Test">
		<groups>
			<run>
				<include name="Mobile login" />
				<include name="HomeLoan" />
			</run>
		</groups>

		<classes>
			<class name="Test.HomeLoanTest"></class>
			<class name="Test.CarLoanTest"></class>
		</classes>
		
	</test> <!-- Test -->
</suite> <!-- Suite -->

6. 
Explanation: the <Groups> tag are mentioned inside <Test> Tag. This .xml file will execute @test menthods belonging to group "Mobile login" and "HomeLoan" from 
class HomeLoanTest and CarLoanTest.
Note: Include <exclude> tag to ignore/skip a group.

Other annotations are :
@BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod – These annotations run before and after each test method.
@BeforeClass and @AfterClass – These annotations run once before and after the first @test method in a class
@BeforeTest and @AfterTest – The BeforeTest annotation runs before the @BeforeClass annotation and the AfterTest annotation runs after the @AfterClass annotation
@BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite– These annotations run before and after all tests in a suite have run.
These annotations start the beginning of a test and the end of it, for all the classes in a suite.

TestNG contains a hierarchy among the annotations. This hierarchy is as follows (top being the highest priority):
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite


Additonal Annotations:
1. @DataProvider and @Parameters: Refer 'Parameterizing in Selenium' sheet for details.


Some of the noteworthy features of TestNG are:
1. Helps to perform parallel testing, dependent method testing.
2. Flexibility of running your tests through multiple sets of data through TestNG.xml file or via data-provider concept.
3. Test cases can be grouped and prioritized as per need basis.
4. Provides access to HTML reports and can be customized through various plugins.
5. Test logs can be generated across tests.
